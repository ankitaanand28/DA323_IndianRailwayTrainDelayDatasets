# Indian Railway Express Trains Delay Datasets 
I have created  this dataset and it contain  one csv file that has all the list of  the  trains connecting Guwahati (Assam) to all the four Metro cities in India namely Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. 
And a folder of csv files that has each train route information with delay information too at each stop.
